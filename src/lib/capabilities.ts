/**
 * AUTO-TRACE-W1 (2026-04-30) — Canonical Single-Source-of-Truth for capability
 * counters: exchange list, timeframe list, asset count.
 *
 * Every public surface (track-record dashboard subtitle, signup pricing-card
 * bullets, landing meta tags, README, manifest.json, llms.txt, JSON-LD
 * schema.org `description`) MUST resolve its capability counters from this
 * module — directly (server-rendered) or via `/api/performance-public` proxy
 * (client-rendered). Hardcoded literals like `5 exchanges` or `290+ assets`
 * are forbidden outside a `data-tr-field=` proxy span or a `<!-- SNAPSHOT:
 * * -->` build-time marker block (CI canary in `tests/unit/copy-consistency.
 * test.ts` enforces this).
 *
 * Onboarding the 6th exchange:
 *   1. Implement the new adapter under `src/lib/adapters/<name>.ts`.
 *   2. Add the case to `src/lib/exchange-adapter.ts:getAdapter()` switch.
 *   3. Append the `ExchangeId` literal in `src/types.ts:95`.
 *   4. Append the entry to the `EXCHANGES` array below.
 *   5. Run `npm run snapshot:capabilities` (refreshes static surfaces:
 *      README.md, manifest.json, server.json, llms*.txt, landing/index.html
 *      meta + JSON-LD).
 *   6. `git push` — track-record + signup + pricing cards auto-update via
 *      proxy on next page render (no rebuild needed for client-side surfaces).
 *
 * No literal `5 exchanges` / `<N>+ assets` / `<N> timeframes` is allowed
 * elsewhere; this is the canonical export.
