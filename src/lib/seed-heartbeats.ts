/**
 * seed-heartbeats.ts — OPS-SEED-ORCHESTRATOR-W1 V2-RESUME (CH3-PRE)
 *
 * Per-venue-per-timeframe ATTEMPT-recency heartbeat. The seeder stamps
 * (exchange, timeframe) -> last_attempt_at on EVERY fire, regardless of whether
 * any signal was recorded (the `signals` table only holds BUY/SELL after the
 * HOLD/confidence filter, so recorded-signal recency is a poor seeding-health
 * proxy — see the report-only freshness check). Attempt recency is the true
 * "did the cron fire + reach this venue" signal.
 *
 * Consumers:
 *  - V5(ii) coverage gate (CH3/CH4): all 5 promoted venues fresh per TF post-fire.
 *  - OPS-SEED-FRESHNESS-W1 (future, dispatch-gated): the sole heartbeat paging path.
 *
 * `performance-db.ts` is firewalled (parallel-session domain), so this lives in
 * its own module and reaches the DB through the exported `dbQuery`. The table is
 * SSH-preapplied (CLAUDE.md "pre-apply schema via SSH then deploy code with
 * IF NOT EXISTS idempotency") and also lazily ensured here for fresh-box repro.
 * PG-targeted ($N placeholders) — the seeder's production backend.
