// ── Cross-asset / cross-timeframe signal grid (v1.9.0 L2/L4 activation patch) ──
//
// Pre-computes a 6×7 grid of trade signals (GRID_ASSETS × GRID_TIMEFRAMES) and
// exposes lazy, TTL-cached read APIs. Used by `get_trade_signal` to surface:
//   • L2 (HOLD Rescue):   `closest_tradeable` — the highest-confidence non-HOLD
//                         cell, excluding the requested (coin, timeframe).
//   • L4 (Next-Calls Hints): `try_next` — top-N highest-confidence non-HOLD
//                         cells, excluding the requested (coin, timeframe).
//
// SHADOW-SEED-W1 (2026-04-30): GRID_TIMEFRAMES re-sized from the v1.9.0
// logarithmic ladder ['5m','15m','1h','4h'] to ['1m','3m','5m','15m','30m','1h','2h']
// based on EMPIRICAL CALL DISTRIBUTION (byAsset.count rankings show users
// concentrate on intraday/scalping horizons; 4h is rank #6 with 2,124 calls
// while 30m is rank #4 with 6,429 and 2h is rank #5 with 5,748). Net delta:
// +1m, +3m, +30m, +2h, -4h.
//
// Refresh strategy:
//   • Server-only (OPS-GRID-PROCESS-BOUNDARY-W1): only the long-lived server
//     refreshes; short-lived cron/seed/backfill procs serve cache-or-empty.
//   • Stale-while-revalidate: a stale snapshot is served immediately while a
//     single coalesced background refresh runs (batch weight class). Only a
//     cold cache (never computed) blocks-and-fills.
//   • Promise-coalesced: concurrent callers during a refresh share the same
//     in-flight promise instead of triggering parallel scorer fan-outs.
//   • Cell-isolated: a single scorer throw cannot crash the entire refresh —
//     failed cells are logged at debug level and skipped.
//   • Slow-grid circuit breaker (SHADOW-SEED-W1): if 3 consecutive refreshes
//     each exceed 30s, fall back to FALLBACK_TIMEFRAMES (the v1.9.0 set) for
//     1 hour, then retry full grid. Forensic console.warn only — the fallback
//     is self-recovering, so it never pages (per the alert contract).
