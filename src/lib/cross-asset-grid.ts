// ── Cross-asset / cross-timeframe signal grid (v1.9.0 L2/L4 activation patch) ──
//
// Pre-computes a 6×4 grid of trade signals (GRID_ASSETS × GRID_TIMEFRAMES) and
// exposes lazy, TTL-cached read APIs. Used by `get_trade_signal` to surface:
//   • L2 (HOLD Rescue):   `closest_tradeable` — the highest-confidence non-HOLD
//                         cell, excluding the requested (coin, timeframe).
//   • L4 (Next-Calls Hints): `try_next` — top-N highest-confidence non-HOLD
//                         cells, excluding the requested (coin, timeframe).
//
// Refresh strategy:
//   • Lazy: refresh on read when the snapshot is stale (>60s) or empty.
//   • Promise-coalesced: concurrent callers during a refresh share the same
//     in-flight promise instead of triggering parallel scorer fan-outs.
//   • Cell-isolated: a single scorer throw cannot crash the entire refresh —
//     failed cells are logged at debug level and skipped.

/**
 * Re-entry guard tied to the async causal chain via `AsyncLocalStorage`.
 *
 * `get_trade_signal` now calls `getGridSnapshot()` to surface try_next /
 * closest_tradeable, and the grid refresh itself calls `getTradeSignal` per
 * cell to reuse the exact R1–R6 scorer path. That creates a cycle:
 *   refreshGrid → getTradeSignal → getGridSnapshot → refreshGrid → …
 *
 * A simple module-level boolean would incorrectly short-circuit *parallel*
 * callers that arrive during an in-flight refresh (they'd see `true` and
 * return an empty snapshot instead of awaiting the inflight promise). Using
 * `AsyncLocalStorage` scopes the flag to the async causal chain spawned by
 * `refreshGrid`, so only calls truly originating from inside a refresh
 * short-circuit; unrelated parallel callers on separate async chains
 * continue to wait on the inflight promise as intended.
