#
# WHY. The 7 promoted venues that are neither the fast-4 (BINANCE/BYBIT/OKX/BITGET)
# nor HL — ASTER,BINGX,GATE,HTX,KUCOIN,MEXC,PHEMEX — were seeded ONLY by the
# oversubscribed all-17 3m catch-all line, so they lapsed past the monitor's 45-min
# freshness SLA (the daily "Seed OUTAGE" TG alert). Root cause: the producer's per-TF
# seed lines hardcoded `--exchange-list BINANCE,BYBIT,OKX,BITGET`, decoupled from the
# monitor's dynamic `listVenues('promoted')` SoT. The orchestrator generator's own
# 2026-06-07 comment named this fix: a `--status promoted --exclude HL` line that
# auto-enrolls every promoted venue (incl. future promotions) at RUNTIME — so a venue
# promotion becomes a single `venues.status` flip with no crontab edit, ever.
#
# WHAT. An IDEMPOTENT, backed-up, reviewable SUBSTRING transform of the live crontab
# (NOT a block rebuild — it edits only the intended lines, anchored on their per-TF
# log-file names, so it can never drop/reorder unrelated lines):
#
#   standalone 3m line  (…/seed-3m-standard.log):
#       --timeframe 3m --top 50                              [all 17 venues, ~595s, overruns]
#     → --timeframe 3m --top <TOP_3M> --status promoted --exclude HL
#                                                            [11 venues, ~115s @top-15, fits 180s]
#   orch 5m/15m/30m/1h/2h/4h/8h/12h lines (…/seed-orch-<tf>.log):
#       --exchange-list BINANCE,BYBIT,OKX,BITGET
#     → --status promoted --exclude HL      [+ 5m only: --top 50 → --top <TOP_5M>]
#   orch 1d line (…/seed-orch-1d.log):    LEFT UNCHANGED  (operator: skip 1d for new
#                                         venues; the fast-4 keep their existing 1d)
#   HL legacy lines, --status shadow lines, monitor/equities/canary lines: UNTOUCHED
#
# Concurrency stays 1 (c>=2 overran 13+min historically; architect-pinned to c=1).
# Coin tops on the tight 3m/5m lines were capacity-measured (~35s/venue @ top-50 on the
# CPX42, I/O-bound) to keep 11 venues ≤0.8× cadence at c=1. TOP_3M/TOP_5M are env-tunable.
#
# REQUIRES the deployed seeder to support `--exclude` (OPS-SEED-PROMOTED-RAMP-W1 code —
# deploy that FIRST; the old --exchange-list lines never pass --exclude, so it is safe
# for the code to land before this runs).
#
# Modes:
#   --check              Print a unified diff of the transform. ZERO writes.
#   --apply              Back up the crontab (/opt/crontab.bak-<ts>), transform, validate
#                        (firewall: shadow + HL line counts + total line count unchanged;
#                        1d orch line still --exchange-list), install. Idempotent.
#   --revert <backup>    crontab <backup>.
