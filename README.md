## What's new in v1.10.3

Live since 2026-04-30:

- **Free tier unlocked** — every supported coin + every supported timeframe is now accessible at the free tier (was BTC/ETH only on 15m/1h). The 100-calls/month cap is the only ceiling. HOLD calls remain free at every tier. All 11 timeframes (`1m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 1d`) are callable on demand — your first call for `SOL/4h` or `PEPE/15m` Just Works.
- **`Connect Your MCP Client` docs section** — new walkthroughs for Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, Claude Code, Smithery, and plain HTTP/curl at [`algovault.com/docs.html#connect-mcp`](https://algovault.com/docs.html#connect-mcp). Every config snippet was web-verified against the upstream docs on 2026-04-30.
- **Track-record disambiguation** — the public dashboard shows 9 of 11 timeframes (5m–1d). The `1m` and `3m` timeframes are available via API on-demand but not cron-seeded for public history (sub-5m indicators are noise-dominated by design). One sentence on the dashboard explains it; copy now consistent across landing pages and brand-facts.

> **Upgrading from v1.9.x or earlier?** MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Claude.ai custom connectors, Cursor, Cline) cache the tool list at session start. The free-tier behavior changed in v1.10.3 — even though no tool was renamed, **refresh your tool list** so the client picks up the new permissive responses:
> - **Claude.ai / Claude Desktop**: Settings → Connectors → AlgoVault → toggle off + on (or click "Refresh tools")
> - **Cursor / Cline**: restart the MCP server connection from the integration panel
>
> Cached tool responses from before the unlock may still surface "requires Starter" upgrade hints on free-tier calls. Refreshing fixes it instantly. (See the v1.10.0 entry below for the prior `signal → call` rename context, also subject to this same refresh recipe.)

---

## What's new in v1.10.0

Live since 2026-04-28:

- **`signal` → `call`** rename across the response shape, the tool name (`get_trade_call`), and the public dashboard. `get_trade_signal` is registered as an alias and continues to work for existing agents — no migration needed.
- **`also_see` cross-asset leads** replace `try_next` with cells trimmed to `{coin, timeframe, confidence}`. Direction requires another call.
- **5-exchange + 20-skill catalog refresh** below.

## Why AlgoVault

Most MCP trading servers give you raw data — prices, order books, candles. Your agent still has to figure out what to do with it.

AlgoVault is different. We give your agent **one answer**: a directional verdict with a confidence score, built from a multi-factor composite scoring engine tuned on production quant systems. Every call is tracked, every outcome is measured, and the full track record is public from day one.

**What makes this not just another indicator wrapper:**

- **Composite scoring, not single-indicator noise.** Multiple orthogonal signals — momentum oscillators, trend structure, derivatives positioning, volume dynamics, open interest flow — fused into a single weighted verdict. The weights are calibrated from live market outcome data, not textbook defaults.
- **Regime-aware call generation.** Calls are filtered through a market regime classifier before emission. The engine knows when to issue calls and when to stay silent — a trend-following setup in a ranging market gets suppressed, not broadcast.
- **Cross-venue intelligence.** Full signal generation on 5 exchanges — Hyperliquid, Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget — with native candle, OI, funding, and volume data per venue. Cross-venue funding arbitrage scanning across all venues. Nobody else does multi-exchange derivatives analysis via MCP. <!-- SNAPSHOT-LINE -->
- **Published track record with every release.** Every call is recorded with outcome prices at multiple horizons. Win rate, profit factor, and expected value are computed continuously. No cherry-picking, no survivorship bias.
- **Adaptive scoring.** Indicator weights are retuned monthly from outcome data. The engine learns what works and adjusts — the call you get today is better than the one from last month.
- **Crypto + TradFi coverage.** 710+ assets across 5 exchanges — standard crypto perps on all venues, TradFi perpetuals (stocks, indices, commodities, FX) on Hyperliquid, and liquidity-filtered meme coins. Assets are classified into quality tiers with per-exchange signal generation. <!-- SNAPSHOT-LINE -->

## Try It in 30 Seconds

No code. No API key. No install.

**Step 1.** Open Claude → Settings → Integrations → Add custom connector

**Step 2.** Enter the name and URL:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|

## Tools

### `get_trade_call` <sub>(alias: `get_trade_signal`)</sub>

Returns a composite **BUY / SELL / HOLD** verdict with confidence score for any supported asset on any of 5 supported exchanges — crypto perps, TradFi perpetuals (stocks, indices, commodities, FX), and liquidity-filtered meme coins on Hyperliquid.

Under the hood: a multi-factor scoring engine evaluates momentum, trend structure, derivatives sentiment, open interest dynamics, and volume conviction. Scores pass through regime-aware filters and adaptive post-processing gates before a final verdict is emitted. Only high-conviction calls are generated; the engine stays silent when the edge is unclear.

> Tool name `get_trade_signal` remains registered as an alias for backward compatibility — agents using the old name continue to work without changes. New integrations should call `get_trade_call`.

**Parameters:**
- `coin` (string, required): Asset symbol — e.g. `"ETH"`, `"BTC"`, `"SOL"`, `"GOLD"`, `"TSLA"`, or any of 290+ supported assets <!-- SNAPSHOT-LINE -->
- `timeframe` (string, default `"15m"`): `"1m"`, `"3m"`, `"5m"`, `"15m"`, `"30m"`, `"1h"`, `"2h"`, `"4h"`, `"8h"`, `"12h"`, `"1d"`
- `exchange` (string, default `"HL"`): `"HL"` (Hyperliquid), `"BINANCE"`, `"BYBIT"`, `"OKX"`, `"BITGET"`. TradFi assets (GOLD, TSLA, etc.) are HL-only.
- `includeReasoning` (boolean, default `true`): Human-readable explanation of the call logic

**Output:** v1.10.0 sanitized shape — `call` direction, `confidence` (0–100), bucketed `indicators` (`funding_rate` / `funding_24h_avg` / `funding_state` / `oi_change_pct` / `volume_24h` / `trend_persistence` / `breakout_pending`), detected `regime`, sanitized `reasoning` prose, and `_algovault` metadata for downstream tool composability. The seven raw indicator fields (`rsi`, `ema_*`, `hurst`, `funding_z_score`, `squeeze_active`) were stripped in v1.10.0 to close composite-verdict reverse-engineering.

Responses also include optional `closest_tradeable` (on HOLD verdicts) and `also_see` (top-3 cross-asset leads when the grid has non-HOLD cells), both trimmed to `{coin, timeframe, confidence}` only — direction requires another `get_trade_call` invocation.

**Example response (v1.10.0):**

```json
{
  "call": "BUY",
  "confidence": 78,
  "price": 84250.50,
  "indicators": {
    "funding_rate": 0.0001,
    "funding_24h_avg": 0.00008,
    "funding_state": "NORMAL",
    "oi_change_pct": 2.4,
    "volume_24h": 2381602633,
    "trend_persistence": "HIGH",
    "breakout_pending": "INACTIVE"
  },
  "regime": "TRENDING_UP",
  "reasoning": "Trending regime, upward bias. Funding pressure mild. Volatility neither expanding nor compressed. Trend persistence elevated; momentum structure. Strong conviction from aligned signals.",
  "timestamp": 1712764800,
  "coin": "BTC",
  "timeframe": "1h",
  "also_see": [
    { "coin": "ETH", "timeframe": "1h", "confidence": 82 },
    { "coin": "SOL", "timeframe": "15m", "confidence": 73 }
  ],
  "_algovault": {
    "version": "1.10.0",
    "tool": "get_trade_call",
    "compatible_with": ["crypto-quant-risk-mcp", "crypto-quant-backtest-mcp"]
  }
}
```

### `scan_funding_arb`

Scans cross-venue funding rate differentials across Hyperliquid, Binance, and Bybit. Normalizes hourly vs 8-hour rate conventions, computes basis-point spreads, and ranks opportunities by composite score (spread magnitude, time urgency, and funding conviction from 24h history). OKX and Bitget funding data is available via their respective adapters — arb scanning expansion is planned.

This is the only MCP server that provides cross-venue funding arbitrage intelligence — long one exchange, short another, capture the spread.

**Parameters:**
- `minSpreadBps` (number, default `5`): Minimum spread in basis points to include
- `limit` (number, default `10`): Maximum results returned

**Output includes:** per-opportunity venue rates, optimal long/short direction, annualized spread percentage, and next funding timestamps.

### `get_market_regime`

Classifies the current market environment into one of four regimes: **TRENDING_UP**, **TRENDING_DOWN**, **RANGING**, or **VOLATILE**.

Uses a multi-dimensional classification approach combining directional strength measurement with ADX slope analysis (detecting trend strengthening vs exhaustion), volume-weighted pivot detection, ATR-adaptive funding thresholds, and cross-venue funding sentiment divergence. The regime classification directly informs how `get_trade_call` filters its output — agents can also use it independently for strategy selection and position sizing.

**Parameters:**
- `coin` (string, required): Asset symbol
- `timeframe` (string, default `"4h"`): Candle timeframe for analysis
- `exchange` (string, default `"HL"`): Exchange to analyze — same options as get_trade_call

**Output includes:** regime label, confidence score, underlying metrics (trend strength, volatility interpretation, price structure), cross-venue funding sentiment, and a plain-English strategy suggestion.

## Performance Tracking

Every call is tracked from emission to outcome. No exceptions.

**What we measure:**
- Outcome prices at timeframe-appropriate evaluation windows
- PFE Win Rate — did price move in the call direction at any point during the evaluation window
- Expected Value — probability-weighted average return per call
- Profit Factor — gross wins divided by gross losses
- Peak Favorable Excursion (PFE) and Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE)
- Running statistics per asset, timeframe, and quality tier

**HOLD calls are free** — when the engine says "don't trade," you don't pay. Only BUY and SELL verdicts are charged via x402 or count against subscription quotas. This aligns our incentives: you only pay when we see a tradeable opportunity.

- **HOLD Rate**: Percentage of scans where the engine declines to issue a trade call. A high HOLD rate (currently ~84%) means the engine is selective — it only calls BUY/SELL when conditions align across multiple indicators.

**Infrastructure:**
- Remote mode: PostgreSQL with automated outcome backfill
- Local mode: SQLite at `~/.crypto-quant-signal/performance.db`
- Only high-confidence BUY/SELL calls are tracked — HOLD is excluded
- Signals are tracked per exchange — the track record shows performance on each venue independently

### On-Chain Verification

Every call is hashed (keccak256) at creation time and anchored on Base L2 via daily Merkle batches. This makes the track record tamper-proof — we cannot edit past calls.

- **Contract**: [`0x6485...0f81`](https://basescan.org/address/0x6485396ac981fe0a58540dfbf3e730f6f7bcbf81) (Base L2)
- **Verify any call**: `https://api.algovault.com/api/verify-signal?signalId=<ID>`
- **View all batches**: `https://api.algovault.com/api/merkle-batches`

## Suite Composability

Every tool output includes an `_algovault` metadata block declaring version and compatible downstream tools:

| This tool | Feeds into (Phase 2+) |
|-----------|----------------------|
| `get_trade_call` | `crypto-quant-risk-mcp` (position sizing) · `crypto-quant-backtest-mcp` (validation) |
| `scan_funding_arb` | `crypto-quant-execution-mcp` (optimal entry/exit) · `crypto-quant-risk-mcp` (exposure) |
| `get_market_regime` | `crypto-quant-risk-mcp` (regime-aware sizing) · `crypto-quant-backtest-mcp` (filtered backtests) |

Schemas are designed for composability. All tools share consistent `timestamp`, `coin`, and `_algovault` fields — downstream tools accept these objects directly as input.
