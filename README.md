## Why AlgoVault

Most MCP trading servers give you raw data — prices, order books, candles. Your agent still has to figure out what to do with it.

AlgoVault is different. We give your agent **one answer**: a directional verdict with a confidence score, built from a multi-factor composite scoring engine tuned on production quant systems. Every call is tracked, every outcome is measured, and the full track record is public from day one.

**What makes this not just another indicator wrapper:**

- **Composite scoring, not single-indicator noise.** Multiple orthogonal signals — momentum oscillators, trend structure, derivatives positioning, volume dynamics, open interest flow — fused into a single weighted verdict. The weights are calibrated from live market outcome data, not textbook defaults.
- **Regime-aware call generation.** Calls are filtered through a market regime classifier before emission. The engine knows when to issue calls and when to stay silent — a trend-following setup in a ranging market gets suppressed, not broadcast.
- **Cross-venue intelligence.** Full signal generation on 5 exchanges — Hyperliquid, Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget — with native candle, OI, funding, and volume data per venue. Cross-venue funding arbitrage scanning across all venues. Nobody else does multi-exchange derivatives analysis via MCP.
- **Published track record with every release.** Every call is recorded with outcome prices at multiple horizons. Win rate, profit factor, and expected value are computed continuously. No cherry-picking, no survivorship bias.
- **Adaptive scoring.** Indicator weights are retuned monthly from outcome data. The engine learns what works and adjusts — the call you get today is better than the one from last month.
- **Crypto + TradFi coverage.** 290+ assets across 5 exchanges — standard crypto perps on all venues, TradFi perpetuals (stocks, indices, commodities, FX) on Hyperliquid, and liquidity-filtered meme coins. Assets are classified into quality tiers with per-exchange signal generation.

## Tools

### `get_trade_signal`

Returns a composite **BUY / SELL / HOLD** verdict with confidence score for any supported asset on any of 5 supported exchanges — crypto perps, TradFi perpetuals (stocks, indices, commodities, FX), and liquidity-filtered meme coins on Hyperliquid.

Under the hood: a multi-factor scoring engine evaluates momentum, trend structure, derivatives sentiment, open interest dynamics, and volume conviction. Scores pass through regime-aware filters and adaptive post-processing gates — including funding flow analysis, volatility regime detection, and trend persistence decay — before a final verdict is emitted.

Only high-conviction calls are generated. The engine is designed to stay silent when the edge is unclear.

**Parameters:**
- `coin` (string, required): Asset symbol — e.g. `"ETH"`, `"BTC"`, `"SOL"`, `"GOLD"`, `"TSLA"`, or any of 290+ supported assets
- `timeframe` (string, default `"15m"`): `"1m"`, `"3m"`, `"5m"`, `"15m"`, `"30m"`, `"1h"`, `"2h"`, `"4h"`, `"8h"`, `"12h"`, `"1d"`
- `exchange` (string, default `"HL"`): `"HL"` (Hyperliquid), `"BINANCE"`, `"BYBIT"`, `"OKX"`, `"BITGET"`. TradFi assets (GOLD, TSLA, etc.) are HL-only.
- `includeReasoning` (boolean, default `true`): Human-readable explanation of the call logic

**Output includes:** call direction, confidence score (0–100), all computed indicator values, detected market regime, reasoning narrative, and `_algovault` metadata for downstream tool composability.

Responses also include optional `closest_tradeable` (on HOLD verdicts) and `try_next` (always, when the cross-asset grid has non-HOLD cells) as signal-surface expansion fields — exploration hints across the BTC/ETH/SOL/BNB/XRP/DOGE × 5m/15m/1h/4h grid, not trade recommendations.

### `scan_funding_arb`

Scans cross-venue funding rate differentials across Hyperliquid, Binance, and Bybit. Normalizes hourly vs 8-hour rate conventions, computes basis-point spreads, and ranks opportunities by composite score (spread magnitude, time urgency, and funding conviction from 24h history). OKX and Bitget funding data is available via their respective adapters — arb scanning expansion is planned.

This is the only MCP server that provides cross-venue funding arbitrage intelligence — long one exchange, short another, capture the spread.

**Parameters:**
- `minSpreadBps` (number, default `5`): Minimum spread in basis points to include
- `limit` (number, default `10`): Maximum results returned

**Output includes:** per-opportunity venue rates, optimal long/short direction, annualized spread percentage, and next funding timestamps.

### `get_market_regime`

Classifies the current market environment into one of four regimes: **TRENDING_UP**, **TRENDING_DOWN**, **RANGING**, or **VOLATILE**.

Uses a multi-dimensional classification approach combining directional strength measurement with ADX slope analysis (detecting trend strengthening vs exhaustion), volume-weighted pivot detection, ATR-adaptive funding thresholds, and cross-venue funding sentiment divergence. The regime classification directly informs how `get_trade_signal` filters its output — agents can also use it independently for strategy selection and position sizing.

**Parameters:**
- `coin` (string, required): Asset symbol
- `timeframe` (string, default `"4h"`): Candle timeframe for analysis
- `exchange` (string, default `"HL"`): Exchange to analyze — same options as get_trade_signal

**Output includes:** regime label, confidence score, underlying metrics (trend strength, volatility interpretation, price structure), cross-venue funding sentiment, and a plain-English strategy suggestion.

## Performance Tracking

Every call is tracked from emission to outcome. No exceptions.

**What we measure:**
- Outcome prices at timeframe-appropriate evaluation windows
- PFE Win Rate — did price move in the call direction at any point during the evaluation window
- Expected Value — probability-weighted average return per call
- Profit Factor — gross wins divided by gross losses
- Peak Favorable Excursion (PFE) and Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE)
- Running statistics per asset, timeframe, and quality tier

**HOLD calls are free** — when the engine says "don't trade," you don't pay. Only BUY and SELL verdicts are charged via x402 or count against subscription quotas. This aligns our incentives: you only pay when we see a tradeable opportunity.

- **HOLD Rate**: Percentage of scans where the engine declines to issue a trade call. A high HOLD rate (currently ~84%) means the engine is selective — it only calls BUY/SELL when conditions align across multiple indicators.

**Infrastructure:**
- Remote mode: PostgreSQL with automated outcome backfill
- Local mode: SQLite at `~/.crypto-quant-signal/performance.db`
- Only high-confidence BUY/SELL calls are tracked — HOLD is excluded
- Signals are tracked per exchange — the track record shows performance on each venue independently

### On-Chain Verification

Every call is hashed (keccak256) at creation time and anchored on Base L2 via daily Merkle batches. This makes the track record tamper-proof — we cannot edit past calls.

- **Contract**: [`0x6485...0f81`](https://basescan.org/address/0x6485396ac981fe0a58540dfbf3e730f6f7bcbf81) (Base L2)
- **Verify any call**: `https://api.algovault.com/api/verify-signal?signalId=<ID>`

## Suite Composability

Every tool output includes an `_algovault` metadata block declaring version and compatible downstream tools:

| This tool | Feeds into (Phase 2+) |
|-----------|----------------------|
| `get_trade_signal` | `crypto-quant-risk-mcp` (position sizing) · `crypto-quant-backtest-mcp` (validation) |
| `scan_funding_arb` | `crypto-quant-execution-mcp` (optimal entry/exit) · `crypto-quant-risk-mcp` (exposure) |
| `get_market_regime` | `crypto-quant-risk-mcp` (regime-aware sizing) · `crypto-quant-backtest-mcp` (filtered backtests) |

Schemas are designed for composability. All tools share consistent `timestamp`, `coin`, and `_algovault` fields — downstream tools accept these objects directly as input.
