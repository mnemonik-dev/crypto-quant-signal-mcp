# OPS-VITEST-SUITE-REPAIR-W1 / C4 — local test-baseline regression gate.
#
# Runs the full vitest suite (`vitest run`) AND the node:test canaries (the
# landing/design/geo `.test.mjs` files run via `node --test` in deploy.yml),
# then diffs the failing-FILE set against the committed baseline at
# audits/test-baseline-known-failures.txt. Exits 1 if ANY NEW failure appears
# (a regression) — this substitutes for the absent push-triggered CI greenness
# gate (deploys go via scripts/deploy-direct.sh; push-triggered GHA is flagged
# off). Sibling installer: scripts/install_test_gate_hook.sh wires this into
# .git/hooks/pre-push (composably).
#
# CONTRACT
#   exit 0  — no new failures vs baseline (or warn-mode, or fail-open).
#   exit 1  — at least one NEW failing file/runner vs baseline (block the push).
#
# MODES  (env ALGOVAULT_TEST_GATE)
#   block  (default) — exit 1 on regression.
#   warn             — report the regression but exit 0 (don't block).
#
# FAIL-OPEN (never block a legit push on tooling/infra breakage):
#   missing node_modules / vitest / jq, or a failed `npm run build`, or an
#   unparseable vitest report  → loud WARNING + exit 0.
#
# IDEMPOTENT — read-only against the repo (only writes /tmp logs + the gitignored
# dist/). Safe to run repeatedly; accepts a no-op `--check` flag.
