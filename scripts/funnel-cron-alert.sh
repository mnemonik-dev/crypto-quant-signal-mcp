# ACTIVATION-FUNNEL-AUDIT-W1 (2026-05-28): migrated from direct
# `curl https://api.telegram.org/...` to canonical
# `/opt/algovault-monitoring/send_telegram.sh` wrapper invocation per
# CLAUDE.md `wrapper-pure-pipe-subprocess-contract-3rd-consumer-confirmed`
# permanent rule (opportunistic compliance + 7th wrapper consumer
# alongside the new funnel-leak-detector.py as the 6th).
#
# Wrapper handles: severity gate, 24h cooldown per alert_id,
# DRY_RUN_TG=1 gate, fail-open semantics, recommended_wave template
# resolution. Caller (this script) just builds the body + pipes it.

Meaning: since OPS-FUNNEL-SNAPSHOT-CRON-FIX-W1, exit 3 fires ONLY after the
bounded fetch+rebase+retry is exhausted — i.e. a GENUINE stuck push (origin
unreachable, auth/ref-lock, or repeated rebase conflict), NOT the transient
non-fast-forward race (which now self-heals silently). Investigate host
git/network first; the local commit is intact and re-runnable.
Action: dispatch OPS-FUNNEL-SNAPSHOT-CRON-FIX-W{NEXT} via Cowork → Claude Code (only if a code defect)
